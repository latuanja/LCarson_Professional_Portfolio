                    <p>Photography and videography are big passions of mine, and I appreiate the art of capturing moments that have passed.  To be able to produce a product that can showcase the beauty of what others can (or cannot) see is very special to me.  Below you will find a few of my favorite images that I've captured over the years. I love each of them for their own reasons.  I hope you enjoy!</p>
